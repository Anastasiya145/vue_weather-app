Welcome to the Weather App! This application allows users to search for real-time weather information by city name (using free API - https://www.weatherapi.com/). Enter any city, and the app will retrieve and display current details such as city name, temperature, and weather conditions. Built to provide essential weather data quickly and accurately, the app is ideal for anyone needing fast weather updates.
